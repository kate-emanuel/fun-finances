# Fun Finances

Lightweight budgeting app to allocate monthly income across days, with deductions, savings, and assignable "tickets" for specific items.

How to run locally:

```bash
# macOS / zsh
cd fun-finances
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

Notes:
- Simple in-memory state (no persistence). You can export tickets/deductions if you like; I left that as a follow-up.
